New update for October 2024. Persian digits were predicted with `scikit-learn` models and hard voting. The top estimator was the histogram-based gradient boosting algorithm with accuracy 0.9972 Â± 0.0003 achieved in cross-validation for test dataset.

Image recognition on handwritten Persian digits performed with LeNet-5 architecture. Accuracy achieved on test dataset: 0.9964.
